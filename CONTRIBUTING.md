Requirements:

-   node.js and npm or some other package manager

To clone and run a development server on your machine (that autoupdates when you modify files):

## Pull Requests/Commits

If you are planning to pull or commit to the Meower-Svelte repo, please use the `develop` branch as this keeps things nice and organized for future releases and to prevent bugs.
